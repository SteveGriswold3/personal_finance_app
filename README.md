Hobby App:  Create your own finance dashboard.  Know your Net Worth daily.

## Project Overview
Start Date: 2019-06-09
Description:  Spin up your own app to track you finances.  Like the big fortune 500 keep track of your transactoins and see you net worth.  Knowing your net worth alone can help you build your own wealth.  My dream is to help others gain more financial literacy.

### A Few Details
- Languages:  Python, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, Flask, Jinja, and other as needed.
- Risks:  Best to keep your data locally, and use extreme caution if using a server.  The data should be numbers and transactions.  Do not include any account numbers.  I am not a security developer, nor should use of this app be considered secure.
- Compliance: No industry compliance standards are included in this app.  This is a hobby and not intended to be an industry product.

## Background
I learned Accounting Basic practices in college, and built my own personal ledger, Income Statement, and Account Summary in Excel.  Today that Excel file is nearly 20 worksheets.  With new skills in development I wanted to convert this excel template into an application.  

## Side Effects
Ultimately tracking personal finances at this level is meant to inspire personal accountability.  My hope is to provide an app with basic tracking to use as a resourse to help others understand their own financial position.  Plus if you are a developer you may have your own style to morph this to match.  Have fun and remember this kind of attention to money growth can be addicting.

## Repo Development
I have many hobbies and interests.  Therefore, I am not sure how fast I will get this project to a first working version, but I look forward to sharing my work and growth with others interested in personal finance.

## Getting Started:

## Disclaimer
I am an open source developer, not a financial expert.  Please do not rely on this app for financial advice.  Please seek your own accountant or financial expert.  Anything included in the repo is by personal growth and preference of the developer.  Which should not be used as financial advice nor legal advice of any kind.  Please feel free to copy and modify the app to your own financial desire.
